# Created 01/02/2024
# Updated 07/02/2024 - the functions had several mistakes which I corrected thanks to Blaise Mariner. I also added a two-step version of getting_regions_and_coverage because this function fails when objects are too heavy even with parallelization.

# N.B although the function tissue_specific_methylation creates separate objects for each entries in a list of tissues, a pan-tissue matrix can easily be obtained by applying the function with tissue = c(tissue_oi).
